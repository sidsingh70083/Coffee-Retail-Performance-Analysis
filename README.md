## üéØ Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to transform raw coffee sales data into an interactive and actionable business intelligence tool. This dashboard, built entirely in Microsoft Excel, empowers a coffee company's management team to move beyond static reports, allowing them to dynamically analyze sales performance, identify key trends, and uncover insights related to product, customer, and regional sales.

## üìä Dashboard & Features
This dashboard provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of sales performance, with all components dynamically linked.

### Key Visualizations
* **Total Sales Over Time:** A line chart tracking monthly revenue trends for different coffee types (Arabica, Robusta, Decelsa, Liberica).
* **Sales By Country:** A horizontal bar chart identifying top-performing geographic markets, such as the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.
* **Sales By Customer:** A horizontal bar chart ranking individual customers by total sales, highlighting high-value clients.

### Interactive Controls (Slicers)
The dashboard's core strength is its interactivity. Users can filter the entire dashboard using a combination of slicers:
* **Date Timeline:** Filter sales by any specific time range, from a single month to multiple years.
* **Roast Type Name:** Isolate performance of Dark, Light, or Medium roasts.
* **Size:** Analyze purchasing patterns for different bag sizes (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg).
* **Loyalty Card:** Compare the spending habits of loyalty program members vs. non-members.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
The dashboard's interactivity is powered by **Pivot Tables** and **Slicers**. Multiple Pivot Tables were created from the raw data to aggregate sales by different dimensions (Time, Country, Customer, etc.). All slicers were then connected to these Pivot Tables, enabling any filter selection to dynamically update all charts and metrics simultaneously.

* **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel
* **Key Functions:** Pivot Tables, Slicers, Timeline Slicers, Pivot Charts, Dashboard Design

## üöÄ Skills & Learnings
This project demonstrates my ability to:
* **Data Aggregation:** Use Pivot Tables to effectively summarize large datasets across multiple dimensions.
* **Interactive Dashboarding:** Create user-friendly, dynamic dashboards with Slicers and Timelines that empower non-technical users.
* **Data Visualization:** Select appropriate charts (line, bar) to communicate trends and comparisons clearly.
* **Business Acumen:** Connect data points to understand business performance and identify patterns.

## üìÅ How to Use
1.  Download the `Dashboard.xlsx` file.
2.  Open the file in a compatible version of Microsoft Excel.
